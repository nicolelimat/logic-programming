# logic-programming
This repository contains the programs developed in Prolog language during the Logic Programming course, taught by Professor Luis Eduardo da Silva, in the Computer Science course at UNIFAL-MG. 

## List Exercises
The list exercises assigned for practice and understanding of the language and paradigm:

- **List 1**
- **[List 2](https://github.com/nicolelimat/logic-programming/blob/main/list_exercises_2.pl)**

## Projects
The course also included hands-on projects to apply logic programming principles to various problem domains:
- **[Family Tree](https://github.com/nicolelimat/logic-programming/tree/main/familytree)**: This project showcases how logic programming can be used to represent and query family trees. It provides predicates and rules to define family relationships and enables querying for specific family information.
- **[Sudoku](https://github.com/nicolelimat/logic-programming/tree/main/sudoku)**: The Sudoku project presents a Prolog implementation for solving 4x4 Sudoku puzzles. It utilizes constraint logic programming techniques to generate and solve the Sudoku boards.
- **Wolf, Sheep and Cabbage**: This project simulates the classic puzzle of moving a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage across a river using a boat. It demonstrates how logic programming can be employed to model and solve puzzle scenarios.
